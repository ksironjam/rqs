                is a free open-source program that allows you to search for the requirements parsed from Excel spreadsheets.

                    This software allows you to make the preliminary search for the requirements only. 
                    You should always keep in mind that search results might be outdated.

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">How to search</h3>
            <p>
                It is possible to search for the requirements by <mark>FR ID</mark>, 
                <mark>TMS Task</mark>, or <mark>text</mark>. You may specify a single 
                FR ID, TMS Task or keyword to search as well as several values separated by a comma. 
                There are a few examples indicated below to help get you involved:
